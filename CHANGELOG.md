## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Added automatic local draft persistence for markdown content, GitHub username, selected icons, and selected README sections.
- Added a `Clear Draft` control in the markdown editor to reset the saved local draft and selected sections.

### Changed

- Updated the preview action button styling so the eye icon matches the bordered blue copy and insert action buttons.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- Updated Playwright E2E tests: adjusted navigation.spec.ts selectors to match the current Home Hero heading and CTA label (`Open Builder`) so navigation checks are stable; re-ran `npm run test:e2e` — all 24 tests now pass.

### Added

- Added a template section selector to the markdown editor for quickly inserting common README sections.
- Added reusable section preset data and a `useSectionPresets` hook to append selected sections without duplicating existing selections.
- Persisted selected README sections in the shop store so section choices survive page reloads.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Fixed markdown editor and preview containers scrollability in `/shop` section
  - Added `minHeight: 0` to flex containers to enable proper scrolling
  - Replaced MUI TextField with native textarea for reliable scroll behavior
  - Updated Paper background color to match outer container for consistent design
  - Ensured both containers scroll independently with proper overflow handling
  - Improved responsive layout for mobile devices

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- Corrected local Sora font asset paths from `/fonts/Sora/static/*` to `/static/*` in preload and `@font-face` declarations to resolve Vite build-time font warnings.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- Resolved strict lint failures by removing unused imports in template/prompt card implementations and applying formatting fixes in shared quick actions/components.
- Updated Playwright E2E specs to align with the current UI behavior and selectors (drawer navigation, theme toggle/store assertions, markdown editor targeting, and template action flows).
- Stabilized `test:e2e` expectations around current non-persistent editor/username route behavior so the suite reflects actual app state handling.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Playwright end-to-end (E2E) testing infrastructure with comprehensive test coverage
- 7 test suites covering navigation, theming, markdown editing, GitHub integration, components, templates, and export features
- E2E test scripts: `npm run test:e2e`, `test:e2e:ui`, `test:e2e:debug`, `test:e2e:headed`
- Playwright configuration for chromium browser with CI/CD integration
- Test documentation and best practices guide (`tests/e2e/README.md`)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow documentation (`CI_WORKFLOW.md`, `CI_FIXES.md`)

### Fixed

- **CI/CD Workflow**: Fixed GitHub Actions conditions for proper branch handling
  - Changed PR branch condition from `github.ref_name` (wrong for PRs) to `github.base_ref` (correct target branch)
  - Added missing `main` branch to push trigger (was only triggering on develop pushes)
  - Separated smoke tests and full E2E tests to prevent duplicate runs
  - Fixed condition evaluation for edge cases (e.g., PR to main now properly triggers full tests)
  - Improved artifact naming with unique `github.run_id` identifiers
  - Updated artifact paths to include `blob-report` for comprehensive test coverage
